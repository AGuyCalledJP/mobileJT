        + Age
        + Class schedule for the semester
        + Phone number
        + Housing information (?)
    - See a list of all classes they must attend for the day, including the location and time of said class
    - Be able to geo tag / check in when they have/are attending a class for that day
    - Have the option to select the number of meals they would like to eat in a day, then dependent on the premade schedule around the classes, the system should suggest different times to eat, as well as give caloric intake breakdowns including necessary protien, carb, and fat intake for each meal
    - Integration with google calender will populate a given days work load with any sports related tasks as well. These tasks will have been set by a coach via google calendar
